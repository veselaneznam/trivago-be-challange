Hilton,"Found this hotel by reading over tripadvisor while planning a little beach getaway. Really good price by the beach. James the front desk manager was really fun, he made our stay more fun than we thought it would be. We are going to come back with our friends soon.",Vesela,,
Tesla,"Across the road from Santa Monica Pier is exactly where you want to be when visiting Santa Monica, as well as not far from lots of shops and restaurants/bars.Hotel itself is very new & modern, rooms were great. Comfortable beds & possibly the best shower ever!",Vesela,,
,"I have stayed here 4 or 5 times while visiting LA. Despite travelling all over the world and staying in some of the best international hotels ( for work), Hotel Caliornia is one of my absolute favourites. Perfect location, right on the beach. I love the way you can just open your door and be outside, no elevators, corridors big glass windows. The ambience is so nice, retro perfect. As for the staff, I have had consistently superb service, with much more personal service and attention to detail than is usual in bigger hotels. Aaron and Katy were just two who have been exemplary this time but really everyone is terrific. Can't recommend it highly enough.",Vesela,,
Tesla,"Terrible. Old, not quite clean. Lost my reservation, then ""found"" a smaller room, for the same price, of course. Noisy. Absolutely no parking, unless you luck out for the $10 spaces (of which there are 12). Water in bathroom sink would not turn off. Not hair dryer, no iron in room. Miniscule shower- better be thin to use it!",Vesela,,
